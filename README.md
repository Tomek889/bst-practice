# Binary Search Trees Practice

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The tree supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order), and balancing.

## Features
- **Insertion**: Add a new node to the BST.
- **Deletion**: Remove a node from the BST.
- **Search**: Find a node by its value.
- **Traversal**: Perform depth-first and breadth-first traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order).
- **Height**: Calculate the height of a node.
- **Depth**: Calculate the depth of a node.
- **Balance**: Check if the tree is balanced.
- **Rebalance**: Rebalance the tree to maintain balance.
